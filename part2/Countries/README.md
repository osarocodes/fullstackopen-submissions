# Country Data Finder

https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/restcountries/ provides an api service that offers a lot of information related to different countries in a so-called machine-readable format via the REST API. So I used that api to create an application that allows you to view information from different countries incuding their weather information.

The user interface is very simple. The country to be shown is found by typing a search query into the search field.
